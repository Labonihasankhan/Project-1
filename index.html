Then, I found an institution <b>"Shikhbe Shobai"</b> and they have encouraged me to take a new route of my life with proper guidance. I always yearn to learn and take challenges. Thats why, I choose to learn <b>The world of coding and development</b>. 
	Currently, I am working as <em><b>Freelancer</b></em> and making myself more trained in <em><b>Website Design and Development</b></em>.</p>
